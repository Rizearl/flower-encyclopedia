                <h3>About Roses</h3>
                <p>The rose, a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, is widely known for its beauty and fragrance. There are over three hundred species and thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Roses are extensively cultivated for their beautiful flowers, which range in color from white to various shades of yellow and red. The cultivation of roses dates back thousands of years, with evidence of their presence in ancient gardens. They are used in perfumery, for medicinal purposes, and as a source of rose hip, a fruit rich in Vitamin C. Different colors of roses often symbolize different emotions: red for love, yellow for friendship, and white for purity. Hybridization has led to an astonishing variety of forms, sizes, and petal arrangements, making roses a favorite subject for florists and gardeners alike. The versatility of roses allows them to be grown in various climates and settings, from formal rose gardens to wild, natural landscapes. Their iconic beauty and rich history make them one of the most beloved flowers worldwide, a true testament to nature's artistry.</p>
