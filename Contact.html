                <h3>About Jasmines</h3>
                <p>Jasmine is a genus of shrubs and vines in the olive family (Oleaceae). It is widely cultivated for its fragrant flowers, which are typically white or yellow. The plant is often used in perfumery, as a tea ingredient, and in religious ceremonies. Many species of jasmine are known for their strong, sweet scent, which is particularly potent at night. The flower is a symbol of love, beauty, and purity in many cultures. There are over 200 species of jasmine, native to tropical and warm temperate regions of Eurasia, Australasia, and Oceania. Its delicate blooms are often used in traditional floral arrangements and garlands. The plant can be either deciduous (shedding leaves in autumn) or evergreen, and its leaves can be either opposite or alternate. Beyond its ornamental and aromatic uses, some jasmine species have traditional medicinal applications, often used for their calming and soothing properties. The versatility and widespread appeal of jasmine have made it a globally cherished flower, often associated with relaxation and elegance. Its ability to thrive in various conditions makes it a popular choice for gardens and indoor cultivation alike, bringing its delightful fragrance to many homes.</p>
