                <h3>About Bunga Raya</h3>
                <p>The Bunga Raya, or Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, is the national flower of Malaysia. It's a vibrant and showy flower, typically red with a prominent stamen, but it also comes in various colors such as pink, orange, yellow, and white. This beautiful bloom is often found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, valued for its ornamental beauty and used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Its five petals are symbolic of the 'Rukun Negara', the five guiding principles of Malaysia. The plant is a popular choice for gardens and landscaping due to its striking appearance and relatively easy cultivation. It can grow as a large shrub or a small tree, reaching several meters in height under ideal conditions. The flowers typically last for a single day, opening in the morning and wilting by nightfall, but the plant produces new blooms continuously throughout its flowering season. This characteristic makes it a symbol of short-lived beauty and transient nature in some cultures, while in others, its continuous blooming represents resilience and life. The extract from its leaves and flowers is sometimes used in traditional medicine for various ailments, and in culinary arts, the petals can be used to make refreshing drinks or dyes. Its adaptability to various soil types and its resistance to many common pests make it a favorite among gardeners. The Bunga Raya is not just a symbol; it's a testament to the rich biodiversity of tropical ecosystems.</p>
